data analyst note week 2

the data analysis process phases are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. You might remember me saying earlier that this entire program is modeled after these steps.

how do data analysts bring data to life? Well, it starts with the right data analysis tool. These include spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and visualization software.

The life cycle of data is plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy. Let's start with the first phase, planning. 

A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system.



Variations of the data life cycle

You learned that there are six stages to the data life cycle. Here is a recap:

Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.
